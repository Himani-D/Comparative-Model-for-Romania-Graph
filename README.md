# Comparative-Model-for-Romania-Graph
This is a comparative model which compares various problem solving search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence specifically on Romania Graph. Various Informed and Uninformed search algorithms are implemented and both Tree search and Graph search is compared. Mainly the algorithms includes 
    1.	Breadth First Search (BFS)
    2.	Depth First Search (DFS)
    3.	Depth Limited Search (DLS)
    4.	Iterative Deepening Depth First Search 
    5.	A* Search â€“ Informed Search

The start Node is Arad and goal node is Bucharest.
For the comparison purpose, 
1.	Number of nodes generated by the algorithms 
2.	Depth at which solution (goal node) is present in each algorithms

The Graph version of the algorithms and Tree versions are displayed separately and on each selection the result is displayed on the result board.
Comparisons are made on various factors like nodes generated, depth at which goal node is present and path cost.
